# Audit Detector (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/Audit-Detector/StackAuditDetector.user.js)&#8202;)

Audits can be annoying. For certain queues, it's not that uncommon for them to [be wrong](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/303795/i-do-not-understand-why-i-failed-this-audit). If you're experienced with reviewing and Meta moderation discussions, and are *sure* you understand the way things are supposed to be done, you can install this userscript to give you a visual indicator when a review task is an audit.
