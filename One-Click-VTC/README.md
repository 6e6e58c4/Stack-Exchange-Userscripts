# One Click VTC (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/One-Click-VTC/StackOneClickVTC.user.js)&#8202;)

If you VTC on Stack Overflow a lot, you can use this userscript to choose a close reason immediately (and downvote too, if you want) in a single click, rather than have to navigate through the pop-up interface first.

This is intended for those with reasonably wide screens. The VTC reasons are put in a container to the left of the main page content; you may also wish to [disable the left sidebar](https://stackoverflow.com/users/preferences/) to free up space.

You'll still have to open the pop-up interface in order to VTC as duplicate or with a custom reason.
