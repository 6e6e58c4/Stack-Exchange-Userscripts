# Hide Roomba Bound Posts (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/Hide-Roomba-Bound-Posts/StackHideRoombaBoundPosts.user.js)&#8202;)

Delete votes are limited to 30 per day, maximum, but horrible posts that do not deserve to remain on the site appear at a rate far exceeding that. Luckily, we have the [roomba](https://stackoverflow.com/help/roomba) which will automatically delete closed and poorly received questions, under certain conditions.

Use this script to save your delete votes for posts that actually need it - for posts that the system won't automatically delete itself.

Keep in mind that a question having a zero or negative score is one of the conditions for the roomba. If you're trying to conserve your delete votes, remember that sometimes, a question only needs a downvote for it to be removed, which is far easier to achieve than 3 delete votes. You may consider using [Roomba Forecaster](https://stackapps.com/questions/7239/) to identify these situations automatically.
