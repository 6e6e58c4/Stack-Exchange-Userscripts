# Instant Syntax Highlighting (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/Instant-Syntax-Highlighting/StackInstantSyntaxHighlighting.user.js)&#8202;)

While writing a post, syntax highlighting on the post preview will only occur after 5 seconds of inactivity, by default. This userscript reduces that debounce time to 200 ms, so that code gets syntax highlighted near immediately.

Installing this *might* result in decreased performance for lower-end machines when the code blocks to be processed are long and complicated.
