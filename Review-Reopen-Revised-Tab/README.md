In the Reopen queue, you may prefer to look at the "Question (revised)" tab, which shows the plain question in its current state, rather than the "Revision" tab, which shows the question *and* the edits that were made to it after closing.

While being able to see what *exactly* was changed after closure is a handy option to be easily accessible, it's more important to consider whether the question *as a whole, in its current state* is worthy of reopening.

Unfortunately, clicking the "Question (revised)" tab does not persist over multiple review tasks - every new task you get, you'll have to click the tab again. This userscript automatically clicks on the "Question (revised)" tab when a new task appears.
