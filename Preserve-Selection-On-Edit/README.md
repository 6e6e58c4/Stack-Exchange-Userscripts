# Preserve Selection On Edit (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/Preserve-Selection-On-Edit/StackPreserveSelectionOnEdit.user.js)&#8202;)

When looking at a post, you may be attempting to copy code from it while a new edit notification appears. When this happens and you release the mouse button, the post body will be replaced, and the text you just tried to select for copying will no longer be selected.

This userscript prevents posts from being replaced on click if you just selected text inside.
