# Post Notices Absolute Dates (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/Post-Notices-Absolute-Dates/StackPostNoticesAbsoluteDates.user.js)&#8202;)

When on a question page, questions and answers use absolute dates, eg "asked Nov 21 '11 at 0:01", "answered Nov 21 '11 at 8:02". Post notices, on the other hand, use *relative* dates, eg "Closed 7 years ago", which are less precise *and* make it harder to determine how long it was between when the question / answers were posted and when the notice appeared.

This userscript fixes that by making the post notices use absolute dates instead of relative dates (when the post notice is at least 2 days old).
