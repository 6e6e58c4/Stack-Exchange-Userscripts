# Ask Dates Everywhere (&#8202;[install](https://github.com/CertainPerformance/Stack-Exchange-Userscripts/raw/master/Ask-Dates-Everywhere/dist/StackAskDatesEverywhere.user.js)&#8202;)

When browsing question lists on the front page or on the Active tab, it can be hard to tell whether a given question is in the list was posted recently, or whether it's an old post someone made an (often unimportant) edit to. This userscript adds ask dates to every question which doesn't already have them.
